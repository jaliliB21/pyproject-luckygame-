# pyproject-luckygame-
Hello
I hope you are well.The project you are currently considering was a two-person project that is half-finished.
Project description:
There is a console game called Box of Chance that I designed in Python in a class-oriented way
First, the code was written as a function by my teammate, and then I converted the code into a class-oriented mode.
The project was supposed to become a graphic game, which was stopped due to reasons such as the lack of cooperation of a teammate.
